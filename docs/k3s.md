### k3s

#### Prerequisites

To be able to set up the infrastructure you need a linux machine (tested with Ubuntu 20.04) with docker installed.
All other tools like kubectl, k3s and helm are set up using the `./scripts/init-cluster.sh` script.

#### Create Cluster
You can use your own k3s cluster, or use the script provided.
Run this script from repo root with:

`./scripts/init-cluster.sh`

If you use your own cluster, note that jenkins relies on the `--docker` mode to be enabled.

In a real-life scenario, it would make sense to run Jenkins agents outside the cluster for security and load reasons,
but in order to simplify the setup for this playground we use this slightly dirty workaround:
Jenkins builds in agent pods that are able to spawn plain docker containers docker host that runs the containers.
That's why we need the k3s' `--docker` mode.
